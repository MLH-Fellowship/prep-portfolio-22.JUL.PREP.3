## Inspiration

We where having college viva exams and there was no place to post your question and answers together, so I made a small application initially then modified to this new version.

## What it does

Plycard is a website user can post question on various topics and other users can answer them. Each user has to sign up with a form or Google Auth. Once the user is signed a user can like a post, share a post and comment on any post. Every user has the ability to post new question on the website.

## How I built it

I used React Js as the major frontend framework and node js for the backend. I started with Nodejs and build all the API's first then I made the frontend. Frontend - React Js, Material UI, Redux, Redux-thunk, Axios backend - Node Js, Express, Database - MongoDB Testing - Jest, Super Tests

## Challenge I ran into while building

While implementing the search feature, I was unable to get the required data from the mongodb as I was running a wrong SQL query. Later I fixed and It started working.
