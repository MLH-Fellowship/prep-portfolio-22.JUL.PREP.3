## Inspiration

To provide real time covid-19 information to the public during the pandemic.

## What it does

To provide real time covid-19 information to the public during the pandemic.

## How I built it

Worked in a team of four during the hackathon. My responsibility was in the implementation of the dashboard to dynamically fetch Covid-19 statistics using the Rest Api provided by Postman. I was also actively involved in the implementation of a chart feature library which was integrated into the react web app to show covid-19 statistics across various weeks and months.

## Challenge I ran into while building

It was my first time using an API. So I spent a chunk of time on research inorder to properly fetch data from the rest api. Working in different time zones.
