## Inspiration

Struggling with what to cook/eat every day

## What it does

Users can input the ingredient(s) that are left in their fridge to get a list of food recommendations based on the ingredient(s) they have along with the recipes to cook the food

## How I built it

I used Spooncular API to fetch recipes data. Also, React/JS was used to build the UI components of the app.

## Challenge I ran into while building

UI components are not aligned well with each other. Plus, the API fetch is invalid and cannot fetch proper data. However, everything was finally resolved.
