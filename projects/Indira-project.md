## Inspiration

Female-identifying entrepreneurs and business owners are very under-represented as compared to male entrepreneurs. This webapp was built to showcase female-owned businesses and allow women to promote their talents while earning money through the platform.

## What it does

Female entrepreneurs can sign up their businesses and directly sell their products on the website. They can also make business posts promoting their new products that users can view. On the other hand, users are able to locate nearby businesses based on their area. They can support them by purchasing their products and supporting their posts.

## How I built it

The frontend was designed using simple HTML/CSS and the backend was built using Python Flask.

## Challenge I ran into while building

Beating the clock since this was done for a hackathon, so me and my team only had 24 hours to build it.
